* This is a free app designed to simulate color-blinded vision and assist color-blind people to differ the colors using real-time camera filters
* You can select one of six filters using the menu at the bottom. First three filters simulate one of three types of color-blindness: Protanopia, Deuteranopia and Tritanopia

* Images can be captured at any time or be uploaded from the gallery and have filters applied to them.
* If you are color-blind, you can select an assistance filter which will help you differ the colours.

* If you are doubting what colour you are looking at, you can turn on the colour picker which tells the real color you are looking at no matter what filter is on.
